    <h1>After Thoughts</h1>
    <h3>Overall:</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Could have use some bootstrap to make the web pages more appealing and have some user interaction</li>
        <li>The Domain wasn&#39;t utilized as much as it should have been making the view do more work than it should</li>
        <li>Should have made the writting more abstract making any change harder</li>
        <li>Could have followed the SOLID principle a bit more making the code harder to read</li>
        <li>Make the entire database first or make the user interface first..... I might be leaning to the user interafce first then the database</li>
        <li>Learn how to use querries would have been helpful for making edits to the database data.</li>
        <li>Is there a better way to carry data from page to page than the use of session?&nbsp; Should have used MVC </li>
        <li>&nbsp;Need to work on using Interace </li>
        <li>Possibly more catches for validation or possilble undiscovered errors</li>
        <li>Way too many classes in one class.&nbsp; Not sure if it&#39;s bad but it doesn&#39;t seem like the best way to go about</li>
    </ul>
        <h3>Login:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Not the prettiest thing</li>
            <li>Main problem is the lack of html and css experience (just started learning it and need to practice big time)</li>
            <li>Valildation works and could possibly have different error outputs.&nbsp; Maybe use &quot;try catch&quot; instead of an &quot;if&quot;</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Create Account:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>More info would be nice but this is more of a test</li>
            <li>Should I use &quot;try catch&quot; instead of &quot;if&quot;</li>
            <li>Better display of error</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Home:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This could have been much more user interface friendly</li>
            <li>Displaying the Id of the customer was not the best option to rely on pulling info.</li>
            <li>Viewstate would have been perfect but I realized too late</li>
            <li>Couldnt store an object into Viewstate but I could have possibly broken each column into a different Key...... Worth testing and noting</li>
            <li>Gave way to much work for the view.&nbsp; The Domain should have been used more for the logic</li>
            <li>A much needed rework on the user interface too simplify both the UI and the code</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>After Thoughts:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>This was a bit ahead of where I was but I learned quite a bit in the process</li>
            <li>Some problems was just knowing small things, such as being able to type the foreign key in the table data.&nbsp; I thought I needed SSMS which was not the case</li>
            <li>I am thankfull that I have LINQ which helped with filtering the database but I need to learn how to utilize an actual query.&nbsp; Something about using and a adapter..... I&#39;ll learn it next</li>
            <li>Perfectly comfortable with getting and storing data in the database.</li>
            <li>Learned how to make querries with SSMS just not how to implement them into code.&nbsp; But it made LINQ useful</li>
            <li>Learned html and css for MVC but then pulled away from it.&nbsp; Still good to know though!</li>
            <li>Things to work on would be making the code more abstart and following the single principle more.</li>
            <li>Big thigns to work on is a more interactive UI and the use of querries (they would have been so helpful for the bulk of the work)</li>
            <li>There was also a log in Tool and EditGridView option.... A lot of useful stuff I got to try out.</li>
            <li>Did I truely really need the Foreign Key for table realtions??</li>
        </ul>
    <p>
        Main take away is that 5 weeks of accelerated learning will only do so much.&nbsp; Still have many things to struggle on and discover.</p>
